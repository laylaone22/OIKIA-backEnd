# [Oops! I Kill It Again](https://github.com/laylaone22/OIKIA-backEnd)

How many times did you get a plant as a present? or you got one from the shop just for fun?
How many times did you prepare your garden looking forward to the best harvest of your life?

How happy were you when you water your green friends for the first time and promised yourself to take care of them?

The reality is unfortunately that you probably killed all of them again, and again ... and again!!
